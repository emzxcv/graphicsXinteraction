Phong Illumination Shader: The three key components Ambient + Diffuse + Specular can be set in this shader to produce the phong reflection effect. This shader is attached to the game object 'Sun' to produce the lighting that simulates a sun. 

Height Dependent Tint Shader: This shader is used to change the colour of the terrain for different heights. The heights and colours are set as variables that can be configured in the components section. The height closest to the peak will be white to simulate snow on the summit and the bottom is blue to simulate water.
